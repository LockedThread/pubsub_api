## Goals
To deliver users the latest deals on Publix subs, via email or through the api via various mediums such as: Discord bots, Slack Bots, or other functionality

## How to use
The site is hosted at https://pubsub-api.dev and has a grid based system in displaying subs. There are three buttons and they all control the filtering system for deciding which subs you want.

### All Button
All displays both not on sale and sale subs.

### On Sale Button
On Sale displays subs currently on sale.

### Not On Sale Button
Not On Sale displays subs that are currently not on sale.

### Newsletter
By clicking the email icon near the footer, user may sign up to recieve emails from pubsub-api.dev in regards to selected subs. Options may be changed by returning to the newsletter icon and changing the options, only the email is required while the rest can be changed to what the user pleases.

## Playground
To get a feel for how the API responds and the various endpoints, you may test them on https://api.pubsub-api.dev/apidocs/. These various functions are what the API uses and responds with. This is very handy for using in regards to requesting data via endpoints.
